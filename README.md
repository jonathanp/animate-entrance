# animate-entrance

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

> A jQuery plugin for animating the entrances of DOM elements as they appear in the viewport.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save animate-entrance
```


## Usage

```js
$('.selector').animateEntrance({
    className: 'is-entered',
    threshold: 0.5,
    throttle: 100
});
```


## Options

### className
What class name to add to the elements when they appear in the viewport or has been scrolled past. This class is what should trigger the CSS animation. Default: `has-entered`.

### threshold
The threshold should be a value between 0 and 1 and defines how much of the element that has to be visible in the viewport for the CSS class specified in `className` to be added. If we'd use a value of 0 the class would be added as soon as the element appears in the bottom of the viewport. If we were to use the value of 1 the class would be added as soon as the whole item is in the viewport. Default: `0.5`.

### throttle
Set `throttle` to a value greater than 0 to only call the class adding function at most once per every `throttle` milliseconds. Default: `100`.
